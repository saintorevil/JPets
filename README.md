 A simple standalone pets resource for FiveM

With JPets, players can spawn in a range of animals (where **you** can configure it) which can attack and follow. This was mostly made for vMenu servers that want to implement pets someway (but feel free to use it anywhere you want).

## Usage

* Download and put the files in your server's resources folder and ensure it in server.cfg.
* Configure the config.lua to your liking.
* Now start your server and load up your game.
* Execute /createPet \<petname> -- This name is set in your config.lua
* Point at a ped to attack and press `E` (by default).
* Enjoy!

There are two commands that are supported with this, those being:

* createPet \<petname> -- Does what it says (pet name set in config.lua).
* tpPet -- TPs your pet (if active)

## Configuration

It is highly customizable with all of these options available straight away. I would like to actively expand this resource however and am open to any and all suggestions anyone may have!
